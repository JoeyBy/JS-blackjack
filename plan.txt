Plan for the MVP:

HTML/CSS:

User interface- needs to display the cards for all players, and their total.
We could start with 3 players + dealer to keep it simple.
All interaction could be handled by prompts, for now. 

JS Functions:

newGame() {
	
	Starts a new game and generates a deck of cards.

}

deal() {
	
	Deal cards to all 3 players + dealer, then checks for blackjacks, then decides whose turn it is, and calls playersTurn

}

playersTurn(player) {
	
	Prompt player to hit or stay, and call the according function

}

hit() {
	
	Deal the player one new card, recalculate total value, and either prompt for hit or stay again, or move to next player (if bust/blackjack), logging the player's total to array or object.
	Either call playersTurn for next player, or if last player, call dealersTurn

}

stay() {
	
	Log the player's total, and move to next player
	Either call playersTurn for next player, or if last player, call dealersTurn

}

dealersTurn() {
	
	Decide whether to hit or stay.
	Once dealer decides to stay, log his total and call endGame

}

endGame() {
	
	Compare each player's total, declare victor(s). Prompt to play again.

}

We could split the files into setup.js, player.js, and dealer.js.
